              Genentech sticks with Lucentis over cheaper Avastin
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Drugmaker Genentech developed and received FDA approval for Lucentis to treat wet AMD. Genentech also developed Avastin to treat colon cancer.6  Despite learning early on that Avastin may show promise against wet AMD, Genentech never formally submitted Avastin to the FDA for formal approval to treat it. It was up to ophthalmologists and researchers to recognize the similarity and benefit of switching to off-label Avastin.

              Little incentive to develop an “off-label” drug
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Why didn’t Genentech pursue FDA approval for Avastin? Genentech had little incentive. Given the resources that go into developing a new drug, it’s reasonable to assume Genentech was heavily invested in the continued success of higher-priced Lucentis.7 Regulatory and market forces encouraged Genentech’s position. Lucentis had FDA approval, which meant it could be marketed as having passed the highest standard of evidence for its use. The unique dynamics of the coverage and reimbursement systems in the U.S. meant the drug would find a big market.

              Research comparing off-label to on-label drugs is rare

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Before prescribing any drug off-label, doctors review the evidence to assess effectiveness. Yet comparative effectiveness research in the U.S. is rarely conducted, and when it is, statute limits the ways in which payers, including Medicare, can use that research in making coverage decisions.<sup>8</sup> But one of the most influential comparative effectiveness studies ever conducted in the U.S. found that these two treatments have equivalent effects on visual acuity improvements when prescribed on the same schedule, without marked differences in adverse clinical events.<sup>9</sup>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              In most cases, Medicare pays providers directly and physicians receive 106% of the average sale price for Medicare Part B drugs. This means higher-cost drugs generate more revenue. Other factors also influence doctors’ decisions, including training, clinical preference, academic literature, and the marketing efforts of drug companies. Clinicians ultimately must balance all of these elements and prescribe the drug they feel is best suited to treat their patients.<sup>10</sup> Given the alignment between a higher reimbursement potential and FDA approval, it is not surprising many doctors prefer Lucentis.

              Numerous other drugs for wet AMD, such as Eylea, have come to market over the past 15 years, creating competition for Lucentis.<sup>11 12</sup> Despite Avastin’s cost advantage, Eylea had the highest market share (43.3%), according to one estimate. Avastin was second (36.4%) followed by Lucentis (20%).<sup>13</sup>

              At present, Lucentis costs Medicare approximately 13 times more per year.<sup>14</sup> The higher price of FDA-approved drugs to treat wet AMD reverberates through the healthcare system, costing patients and taxpayers millions of dollars. This limits the ability of the health care system to leverage Avastin’s substantially lower price.

              What might influence doctors to prescribe Avastin? One scenario would be participation in risk-bearing payment models where payments are capped or tied to the use of highly effective but less costly therapies.<sup>15</sup> Research shows that if Medicare increased the reimbursement amount for Avastin it could increase usage and save patients millions in copayments, thus expanding access.<sup>16</sup>
