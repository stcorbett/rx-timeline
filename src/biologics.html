              ‘Patent thicketing’ extends protections for biologics
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Manufacturers of biologics approved by the FDA receive a 12-year exclusivity period, seven years longer than the patent exclusivity period granted to other drugs. Biosimilars can begin the process of seeking approval to join the market as soon as four years after the approval of the original drug, so they can be ready when the 12-year window closes. However, some manufacturers effectively extend their original patent protection by filing multiple patents based on minor variations on the primary patent.<sup>6</sup> This is known as patent thickening, and it’s not uncommon. On average, each of the top ten selling drugs in the U.S. are protected by more than seven patents each,<sup>7</sup> underscoring the legal and logistical challenges to biosimilars.

              The patent dance invites purposeful delays
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Unlike patent provisions for other drugs, patents protecting biologic innovations are not required to be made public. Instead, biosimilar manufacturers must either create the originating biologic on their own or rely on the private exchange of patent information. They also must disclose their application details to the originating manufacturer in order to resolve possible patent violations. This process, known as the patent dance, can become a delay tactic for manufacturers of reference biologics.<sup>8 9 10</sup> In an effort to discourage purposeful delays, Congress recently passed a law requiring the public listing of some, but not all, biologic patents. However, the Purple Book Continuity Act of 2019 stops well short of full disclosure and adds yet another layer of complexity that may ultimately be used to further delay biosimilar entry.<sup>11</sup>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              When biosimilars come on the market, they tend to bring down the price of treatment. Since the introduction of biosimilars, the cost of Remecade has come down. But Remecade still remains both more expensive than biosimilars and more widely used:<sup>12</sup> a 2023 report shows that biosimilars account for less than half (44%) of total infliximab volume.<sup>13</sup>

              Discounts negotiated throughout the supply chain, including those by the patient’s insurance company and associated Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM), along with other contracting strategies to preserve market share, are commonplace. These discounts, however, are not always passed on to the patient and the impact of these negotiations is the subject of scrutiny across the industry and from the federal government.

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              In 2021, Janssen made available an unbranded infliximab, which is considered the same product as the brand name Remicade, just at a lower price.<sup>14</sup> While it’s difficult to make a definitive statement why Janssen made this move, it’s reasonable to assume it did so to maintain market share with a lower priced medication and offers the possibility of providing a smaller rebate in contracting negotiations.

              Medicare boosted physician reimbursements to encourage use of biosimilars

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Physicians treating Medicare patients have traditionally been reimbursed at a rate of the average sales price <sup>15</sup> plus 6% for a biologic or biosimilar. To encourage doctors to prescribe the biosimilar, the government in 2019 made a change so that biosimilars were reimbursed on the basis of the higher average sales price of the biologic.<sup>16</sup> The Inflation Reduction Act created a further incentive by authorizing a five-year reimbursement increase of the average sales price plus 8% for biosimilars.<sup>17</sup> The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is also considering the development of a focused payment model to further encourage biosimilar use.<sup>18</sup>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              One reason the biosimilar market share for infliximab isn’t higher could be Janssen’s contracting strategies. A 2017 Pfizer lawsuit accused Janssen’s parent company, Johnson & Johnson, of suppressing competition by implementing exclusionary contracts with health insurers and provider organizations.<sup>19</sup> The two companies settled their lawsuit in 2021<sup>20</sup> but the FTC is further investigating Johnson & Johnson to determine if the company violated antitrust laws when it set up a variety of exclusionary contracts, including those with hospitals that bundled much of Johnson & Johnson’s drugs and devices to potentially protect Remicade market share.<sup>21</sup>

              Rebates add another boost to Remicade
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph-content">
              Another contracting strategy includes securing preferred ‘tier 1` placement, meaning the treatment of Remicade is the first choice <sup>22</sup> and often does not require prior authorization, an often onerous step in a patient receiving the medication prescribed by their doctor. The manufacturer secures this placement in exchange for offering meaningful rebates, either on the selected product or others in their portfolio. Rebates are off-invoice amounts that can make up 40% or more of the drug’s list price.<sup>23</sup> As a result, rebates play a consequential, largely invisible role when it comes to the actual prices paid by providers and patients. It can be difficult to assess exact rebate amounts or terms, because there are no uniform reporting or disclosure requirements in place.
